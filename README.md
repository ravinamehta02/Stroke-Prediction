# Stroke-Prediction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Machine Learning (ML) offers a promising approach to predicting stroke risk based on various factors.
This Jupyter Notebook aims to develop an ML model that can predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence in an individual. We will utilize a dataset containing patient information and their stroke history. The model will be trained to identify patterns in the data that are associated with stroke risk.
